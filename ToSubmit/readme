# Instructions to compile source files
   On command window, type "make".
   If that doesn't work for some reason on your system, type
   "gcc -o main pth_BlockMatMult.c lab1_IO.c -g -Wall -lpthread -lm".

   Once it is compiled, if you would like to test it, compile the matrixgen.c
   file (provided in the lab 1 dev kit) with "gcc matrixgen.c -o matrixgen".
   Use that to generate a matrix (using the instructions from the comments of
   that file).

   Next, run our program's executable by typing "./main <number of threads>".

   Finally, you can use the serialtester by compiling the serialtester.c file
   (also provided by the lab 1 dev kit) with
   "gcc serialtester.c lab1_IO.c -o serialtester". Then run the executable
   with "./serialtester"
